              <h3>Spectro-photometric Analysis Around Cosmic Noon: Emission-Lines, Dust Attenuation, and Star Formation</h3>
                  <p class="text">
              Galaxies are the building blocks of the Universe. Understanding their role in the cosmos translates into studying their emitted light 
              from a multi-wavelength perspective as a large variety of physical processes inside them are responsible for the radiation we observe. 
              In this work, a sample of galaxies in the COSMOS field with ultraviolet to far-infrared photometry and Ha, Hb, [OIII]5007 fluxes is 
              studied using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting software CIGALE. The photometry is firstly fitted along with the Ha fluxes to 
              derive robust estimations of the stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and attenuation in the emission lines. A dust-corrected relation 
              between SFR and the [OIII]5007 luminosity is proposed in the same way as it already exists for the Ha emission-line. The dispersion in 
              this relation is studied under the light of the interstellar medium 
              (ISM) properties as the ionization parameter and gas-phase metallicity fitting the photometry and the Ha, Hb, [OIII]5007 fluxes. The nebular 
              emission models inside CIGALE are updated to reproduce the nebular emission of these galaxies at z ~ 1.6. These models are also used to create 
              mock spectra catalogs for the Multi-Object Optical and Near-infrared Spectrograph (MOONS) collaboration. A sub-sample of galaxies in the COSMOS 
              field is fitted covering ultraviolet to mid-infrared photometry. Mock spectra are created including either stellar continuum-only or stellar 
              continuum and nebular emission. The power of including spectroscopic information along with the photometry in the SED fitting process is 
              presented in this work in preparation for future large spectroscopic surveys that will open a new era in galactic and extragalactic Astronomy.

              <h3>Statistical constraints on Gaia data for exoplanetary ringed systems observation</h3>
                  <p class="text">
                  In this work, we present a probabilistic analysis of the occurrence rate of exoplanetary rings. Following a Monte-Carlo and analytic
                  approach to reproduce the stellar mass IMF and the exoplanetary mass-and period-distributions, we proposed low-mass stars below 2.0 Msun 
                  as those candidates with the highest chance to harbor planets orbiting with exoplanetary rings (already formed or in the formation process).
                  The expected number of detections lies between 100 and 10 for a stellar mass range between 0.1 Msun and 2.0 Msun, out of a total number 
                  of 10000 stars and exoplanets period-mass pairs simulated. Using Gaia DR2 data we performed an analysis of the well-known OB association
                  ScoCen (also known as Sco OB2) subdividing the region in three subgroups, Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus-Lupus, and 
                  Lower Centaurus-Crux. For each subgroup, its respective Hertzsprung-Russell was created to pre-select stars between two isochrone models 
                  of 5 Myr and 60 Myr, where the youngest isochrones were corrected by extinction values reported in the literature. Stellar 
                  tracks where also computed probing that our final sample contains stars below 2 Msun to values down to 0.1 Msun which corresponds 
                  to the lower limits of the isochrone-and stellar track-models. However, we can go a bit further down this limit in mass with the new Gaia
                  DR2 data set. The final sample contains 3729, 3309, and 3432 sources in each one of the LCC, UCL and US subgroups. This final 
                  sample of stars is cross-matched to the SuperWASP database in order to retrieve light curves for the selected stars to be 
                  studied, motivated by the light curve of J1407. This cross-matching process let us with 113, 654, and 718 light curves per subgroup
                  but only a final sample of ∼ 20 candidates is proposed after inspecting the light curves and comparing to the actual light curve of 
                  J1407 searching for possible exoplanetary ringed systems or variable star behavior. Additionally, we redefined the original limits of 
                  ScoCen in galactic coordinates to include a larger sky area in a range of 285◦ ≤ l ≤ 360◦ and −10◦ ≤ b ≤ +32◦ and a parallax range of 
                  5 to 12 mas and performed a selection of the young population which led to the natural overall trend and some outstanding over-densities 
                  close to the original boxes. This method allows the study of membership in associations relatively quick as a first step to lately
                  applied a kinematic method and increase the chance of studying a large sample of actual stars belonging to the association.

              <h3>An ALMA survey of sub-millimetre galaxies in the extended chandra deep field south: A blind search for emission lines at 145 GHz</h3>
                  <p class="text">
                    We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 4 (145 GHz) observations of 51 ALESS sources. 
                    A CO(4 → 3)-emission line for ALESS070.1 and ALESS122.1 at 138.88±0.02 GHz and 152.44±0.01 GHz was detected respectively. 
                    Our CO detections have a good signal-to-noise ratio reaching ∼ 6σ and ∼ 10σ for both sources. We measured the line luminosity
                    through this transition and estimate the amount of molecular gas to be in terms of the CO-to-MH2 conversion factor, MH2 = (11.74±4.76)
                    1010 M¯αCO and MH2 = (13.56±4.29) 1010 M¯αCO for each source. In the case of ALESS122.1 we found the CO luminosity ratio to be 
                    r41 = 0.32±0.01 after comparing our integrated luminosity for CO(4 → 3) to the CO(1 → 0) reported in literature. 
                    Our derived spectroscopic redshift of z ∼ 2.0252 and the measured molecular mass for ALESS122.1 are consistent with 
                    previous observations. The redshift measured for ALESS070.1 corresponds to z ∼ 2.3197 and represents a plausible solution to a
                    discrepancy in previous measurements obtained from the optic spectroscopy. An estimation of the dynamical mass for both sources
                    and implications of the CO-SLED for ALESS122.1 were also addressed.

               <h3> Dark matter halo characterization thorugh properties of host galaxies classified in the Hubble sequence</h3>
                  <p class="text">              
              The formation and evolution of galaxies has always been an important topic in order to know
why the universe looks as it does today. In a Λ-CDM scenario dark matter collapses to build up
halos which merge forming bigger halos. According to this theory barionic matter collapses into
the dark matter halo forming galaxies, so, the properties of galaxies are expected to depend on
or to be correlated to the dark matter halo properties. Motivated by the Sloan digital Sky
Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7), data from the New York University Value-Added Galaxy
Catalog (NYU-VAGC) and a classification method performed by Huertas-Company, 2010
[19], we analyzed a sample of galaxies of the SDSS-DR7 to infer the connection between the
structural parameters of the dark matter halo with the properties of the galaxy hosted in that
halo. If structural differences in a given type of galaxy are related to structural differences in their
halos, we are able to infer properties of the halo giving an independent test to the formation of
structures and galaxies.
</p> 
<p class="text">
Data sample obtained from Huertas-Company, 2010 has approximately 600.000 galaxies of
the SDSS-DR7 which are tagged with a probability of belonging to an E,S0,Sab and Scd subclass.
This information was enriched with properties of the objects extracted from NYU-VAGC as the
petrosian magnitudes u,g,r,i,z, velocity dispersion, and the Sérsic’s parameters A,R0 and n in
each band. Using the Color-Magnitude diagram (CDM) and the fundamental plane for each
band we tested the quality of the dataset and the relation between the surface brightness profile
with its respective type. Through the distribution of their Sérsic parameters, we obtained a direct
connection between the dark matter halo parameter as spin, concentration and virial mass (λ,
C, Mv i r ) with the photometric properties of the galaxy as surface brightness, disk scale length
and Sérsic’s index (A,R0,n). Performing inference techniques we studied correlations between
properties of a galaxy with the parameters of the dark matter halo where it should be hosted at.
</p>
<p class="text"> 
It was observed a strong correlation between the Sérsic’s parameters and the Hubble classification
according to the technique shown by Huertas-Company, 2010. There are differences between
galaxies classified as the same type as a function of its luminosity. We assume that we know
how the properties of the dark matter halo are distributed, using this indicates that through an
inference analysis is possible to estimate, at least in an statistical way, the properties of the halo.
Using a a model for dik galaxies it is possible to obtain the disk scale length and the surface density
profile in terms of the dark matter halo structural parameters as concentration, virial mass and
spin. Once the observed disk scale length and the model one are compared, each observed galaxy
inherites the median values which better describes the dark matter halo where they are embedded
at. A correlation between the spin parameter and the concentration (i.e virial mass) is found
which tell us that a given dark matter halo will host a given disk galaxy only if its corresponding
value of spin parameter it is ralated to the concentration. Also, tables corresponding to the results
for the Sab and Scd SDSS-DR7 galaxies are shown which contains information about the disk
and dark matter halo properties assigned after matching the observations with the model.
